## collectiblr: 3d scanning collectibles for the web, VR/AR, and beyond!

Duration: 90 minutes

Description: In this workshop, participants will learn how to create their own 3d forms (with polycam) and learn how to display them on the web (with 3D/AR model viewer). The first half of the workshop will provide participants with the tools and methods to scan and display an object on the web and the second half will be interactive where participants can generate their own objects and view them in a digital environment. Also, participants can contribute their generated object(s) to the collectiblr project.

Materials: iPhone (to use polycam) or camera (to capture images of chosen objects), computer, objects to scan.

Outline of Workshop:
- Part A: Lecture (~45 minutes)
    - Introduction and background of collectiblr (5-10 minutes)
    - How to scan with Polycam + tips (10 minutes)
    - How to Display 3D/AR on Web - Google Model Viewer (10 minutes)
    - Other methods/tools (5 minutes)
    - Workshop Instructions (5 minutes)

- Part B: Workshop+ Q&A: (~30-45 minutes)
    - In this part of the workshop, instructions and support will be given if participants have questions while scanning their chosen objects into .gltf files and plugging these .gltf files into the 3D/AR viewer code.
