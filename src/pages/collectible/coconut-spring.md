This giraffe was collected when I lived in Jakarta and is one of my favorites with its light abstraction of the giraffe form. I appreciate the combination of natural texture, with the small coconut shell and twine, and the black and white pattern on the neck and legs. The neck is also attached on a spring which allows some movement for glances around.
