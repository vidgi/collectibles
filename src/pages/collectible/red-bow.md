This giraffe was from the Aerodrome (Houston ice rink) via a birthday party goodie bag. My neighbor was in figure skating, so it was always fun to learn tricks from her, although I never tried anything extravagant. Despite growing up with the heavy heat and humidity of Houston, a lot of us admired the world of ice skating, growing up with movies like *Go Figure* and *Ice Princess* which just made it seem so cool.
