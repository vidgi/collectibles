This giraffe is a coin bank constructed solidly out of wood. When it is shaken, you can feel the coins inside, however it has never been opened. Somehow, I previously thought there was no way to open it besides cutting it open. But upon recent inspection, I can now see that there is a screw at the bottom. Maybe it will be opened someday and someone will discover the thousands of rupiah inside.
