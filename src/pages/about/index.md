*collectiblr* reflects on what makes something collectible, valuable, and worth remembering with consideration of the presumed permanence of data and the contrasting ephemerality of attention in the internet age. The *collectiblr* project, equipped with augmented reality and 3d capabilities, combines the nostalgia of collectible objects, observations, and memories in a speculative, virtual space. The work transports these physical forms into the digital, confronting viewers with thoughts on physicality, materialism, and past memories. 

Overall, the project is simultaneously an ode to collecting and an exploration of the identities we place in physical objects and digital data, both of which are abstractions of our thoughts and memories.
