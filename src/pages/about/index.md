The *collectiblr* project, equipped with augmented reality and 3d capabilities, combines the nostalgia of collectible objects, observations, and memories in a speculative, virtual space. The work transports these physical forms into the digital, confronting viewers with thoughts on physicality, materialism, and past memories. 

*collectiblr* reflects on what makes something collectible, valuable, and worth remembering with consideration of the presumed permanence of data and the contrasting ephemerality of attention in the internet age.
